\begin{enumerate}
\item Find all shortest paths from $S$ to $T$ and determine the length $s$ of these.
\item Find all longest paths from $S$ to $T$ and determine the length $l$ of these.
\item For which arcs (if any) is it true that shortening that arc by one unit, leaving all others unaltered, will decrease $s$?
\item For which arcs (if any) is it true that shortening that arc by one unit, leaving all others unaltered, will decrease $l$?
\item For which arcs (if any) is it true that lengthening that arc by one unit, leaving all others unaltered, will increase $s$?
\item For which arcs (if any) is it true that lengthening that arc by one unit, leaving all others unaltered, will increase $l$?
\end{enumerate}
