If the edges in a graph $$\Gamma$$ represent connections, it is obvious to ask whether $$\Gamma$$ as a whole is "connected".  There are two seemingly different ways of making this precise; today we introduce these and show that they are the same.

It may be easiest to define what it means for a graph $$\Gamma$$ to be *disconnected*.

Definition: Disjoint union
===

Given two graphs $$\Gamma_1$$ and $$\Gamma_2$$, the *disjoint union* $$\Gamma_1\sqcup \Gamma_2$$ is obtained by taking the disjoint union of both the vertices and edges of $$\Gamma_1$$ and $$\Gamma_2$$.  So $$\Gamma_1\sqcup\Gamma_2$$ consists of a copy of $$\Gamma_1$$ and a copy of $$\Gamma_2$$, with no edges in between the two graphs.

Definition: Disconnected
===

A graph $$\Gamma$$ is *disconnected* if we can write $$\Gamma=\Gamma_1\sqcup \Gamma_2$$ for two proper (i.e., not all of $$\Gamma$$) subgraphs $$\Gamma_1$$ and $$\Gamma_2$$.

It then makes sense to say that $$\Gamma$$ is *connected* if it is not disconnected.  However, the more intuitive notion of being connected is that "you can get from any vertex to any other", which we now make precise.


Walks, Trails, Paths
----

Definition
===
A *walk* in a graph $$\Gamma$$ is a sequence 

$$v_0, e_1, v_1,e_2, v_2,\dots, v_{n-1}, e_n, v_n$$

where 
 - the $$v_i$$ are vertices
 - the $$e_j$$ are edges
 - edge $$e_j$$ goes between vertices $$v_{j-1}$$ and $$v_j$$


Note that, when the graph $$\Gamma$$ does not have multiple edges, it is enough to record just the $$v_i$$, but if $$\Gamma$$ has multiple edges that just knowing the vertices does not determine the walk.



 We say that the walk is between vertices $$a$$ and $$b$$ if $$a=v_0$$ to vertex $$b=v_n$$.  Thus, it is natural to say that a graph $$\Gamma$$ is connected if there is a walk between any two vertices $$a,b\in\Gamma$$.  We now show that this agrees with our previous definition of connected.


Lemma
===
The following are equivalent:

1. $$\Gamma$$ is connected.
2. There is a walk between any two vertices $$v, w\in V(\Gamma)$$

Proof
===

1 implies 2: Supppose that $$\Gamma$$ is connected, and let $$v, w\in V(\Gamma)$$; we want to show that there is a walk from $$v$$ to $$w$$. 

Define $$S\subset V(\Gamma)$$ to be the set of all vertices $$u\in V(\Gamma)$$ so that there is a walk from $$v$$ to $$u$$; we want to show that $$w\in S$$.

First, observe that there are no edges from $$S$$ to $$V(\Gamma)\setminus S$$.  Suppose that $$e$$ was an edge between $$a\in S$$ and $$b\in\Gamma\setminus S$$.  Since $$a\in S$$, by the definition of $$S$$ there is a walk $$v=v_0v_1v_2\cdots v_m=a$$ from $$v$$ to $$a$$.  We can add the edge $$e$$ to the end of the walk, to get a walk from $$v$$ to $$b$$, and hence by definition $$b\in S$$.  

Now suppose that $$w\notin S$$.  Then $$S$$ and $$V(\Gamma)\setminus S$$ are both nonempty, and by the above there are no edges between them, and so $$\Gamma$$ is not connected, a contradiction.

To prove 2 implies 1, we prove the contrapositive.  If $$\Gamma$$ is not connected, then there are two vertices $$v,w\in V(\Gamma)$$ so that there is no walk from $$v$$ to $$w$$. 

Suppose that $$\Gamma=\Gamma_1\sqcup\Gamma_2$$, and pick $$v\in V(\Gamma_1), w\in V(\Gamma_2)$$.  Any walk from $$v$$ to $$w$$ starts in $$V(\Gamma_1)$$ and ends in $$V(\Gamma_2)$$, and so at some point there must be an edge from a vertex in $$\Gamma_1$$ to a vertex in $$\Gamma_2$$, but there are no such edges $$\square$$


Types of Walks
-------

Many questions in graph theory ask whether or not a walk of a certain type exists on a graph: we introduce some notation that will be needed for these questions.
 

We say a walk is *closed* if it starts and ends on the same vertex; i.e., $$v_0=v_n$$.  The *length* of a walk is $$n$$, the number of edges in it.  The *distance* between two vertices $$v$$ and $$w$$ is the length of the shortest walk from $$v$$ to $$w$$, if one exists, and $$\infty$$ if one does not exist.


Walks, trails and paths
======

 - If the edges $$e_i$$ of the walk are all distinct, we call it a *trail*
 - If the vertices $$v_i$$ of the walk are all distinct (except possibly $$v_0=v_m$$), we call the walk a *path*.  The exception is to allow for the possibility of closed paths.


Lemma
===

Let $$v,w\in V(\Gamma)$$.  The following are equivalent:

1. There is a walk from $$v$$ to $$w$$.
2. There is a trail from $$v$$ to $$w$$
3. There is a path from $$v$$ to $$w$$.

Proof
===

Obviously, 3 implies 2 which implies 1, as any path is a trail, and any trail is a walk.  

That 1 implies 3 is intuitively obvious: if you repeat a vertex, then you've visited someplace twice, and weren't taking the shortest route.  Let's make this argument mathematically precise.

Suppose we have a walk $$v=v_0,e_1,\dots, e_m, v_m=w$$ that is not a path.  Then, we must repeat some vertex, say $$v_i=v_k$$, with $$i<k$$.  Then we can cut out all the vertices and edges between $$v_i$$ and $$v_k$$ to obtain a new walk 

$$v=v_0,e_1, v_1,\dots, e_i, v_i, e_{k+1}, v_{k+1}, e_{k+2}, v_{k+2}, \dots, v_m$$.  

Since $$i<k$$, the new walk is strictly shorter than our original walk.  Since the length of a walk is finite, if we iterate this process the result must eventually terminate.  That means all our vertices are distinct, and hence is a path.  $$\square$$


The field of graph theory arguably began with the following question.

The Bridges of Konigsberg
-------------

the city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad) was built on both sides of a river, and contained two large islands.  The 4 sectors of the city were connected by seven bridges, as follows (picture from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg)):

![Konigsberg in Euler's time](Konigsberg_bridges.png)

A group of friends enjoyed strolling through the city, and created a game: could they take a walk in the city, crossing every bridge exactly once, and return to where they started from?  Eventually, Euler proved that such a walk is not possible, and in doing so founded graph theory.

Eulerian Cycles
-------

Before presenting Euler's proof,  let us formulate the question precisely in terms of graph theory, which will also generalize the problem.

We can produce a graph $$\Gamma_K$$, which we will callt he Kingsberg graph, that represents the city of Konigsberg as follows.  There will be four vertices, representing the four land-masses are vertices.  Every bridge will be represented by an edge.

Then, the question reduces to finding a closed walk in the graph that will uses every edge exactly once.  In particular, this walk will not use any edge more than once and hence will be a trail (though it may repeat vertices).


Definition: Eulerian cycle
=====
Let $$\Gamma$$ be any graph. An *Eulerian cycle* or *Eulerian tour* is a walk in $$\Gamma$$ that visits every edge exactly once.  


The citizens Konigsberg were asking whether an Eulerian cycle existed in $$\Gamma_K$$.  Euler did more: he gave simple criterion to tell whether or not *any* connected graph $$\Gamma$$ has an Eulerian tour.  We will now state and prove his result.


Theorem
=====

A connected graph $$\Gamma$$ (without loops) has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex of $$\Gamma$$ has even degree.

Proof
====

First, we show this condition is necessary.  Let $$\Gamma$$ be a connected graph, and suppose that it has an Eulerian cycle $$w=v_0, e_1, v_1,\dots, e_n, v_n$$.  Let $$v$$ be any vertex in $$\Gamma$$; we must show that $$v$$ has even degree.  We will do this by pairing up the edges incident to $$v$$.

Since $$w$$ is a closed walked, we may assume that it does not start at $$v$$.  Then consider the first time that the walk $$w$$ visits $$v$$ -- it will enter by some edge $$e_i$$, and leave by some other edge $$e_{i+1}$$.  We pair these two edges up.  

The walk $$w$$ may visit $$v$$ multiple times; each time it does, it must enter from one edge, and leave from another edge.  Each time the walk $$w$$ visits $$e$$, we will pair up the edge the walk $$w$$ entered with the edge $$w$$ left by.  Since by supposition the walk $$w$$ uses every edge of $$\Gamma$$ exactly once, we see that every edge incident to $$v$$ will be paired up with exactly one other edge in this way, and hence $$v$$ must have even degree.


We now show that this condition is sufficient.  That is, we suppose that every vertex of $$\Gamma$$ has even degree; we must show that $$\Gamma$$ has an Eulerian cycle.  We will proceed by induction on the number of edges of $$\Gamma$$.

Any connected graph with 0 edges consists of just a vertex, and hence trivially has an Eulerian cycle.

Now, for the inductive step, we suppose that $$\Gamma$$ has $$n$$ edges, and further suppose that we know Euler's theorem is true for all graphs with less than $$n$$ edges -- that is, suppose that every connected graph $$\Gamma$$ with less than $$n$$ edges, all of whose vertices have even degree has an Eulerian walk.

We first claim that $$\Gamma$$ has *some* closed trail.  Start at any vertex $$v_0$$.  Since $$\Gamma$$ is connected, $$v_0$$ has at least one edge $$e_1$$ so we start our trail with $$v_0, e_1, v_1$$.  Since every vertex has an even degree, there must be another edge out of $$v_1$$, say $$e_2$$ leading to $$v_2$$.  

We continue building a trail in $$\Gamma$$ by randomly selecting an unused edge of $$\Gamma$$ at our current vertex.  Since every vertex has even degree, and whenever our trail visits a vertex we use up edges two at a time (coming and going), we see that whenever we arrive at a vertex $$v$$, there must be another edge leaving it to continue our trail -- unless perhaps we hit our starting vertex $$v_0$$, where we have only used one edge up.  Thus, if we randomly start building a trail we must eventually return to our starting vertex and obtain a closed trail.

Now, given our graph $$\Gamma$$, we know it has *some* closed trail $$w$$.  If $$w$$ uses every edge of $$\Gamma$$, we are done.  If not, we consider the new graph $$\Gamma^\prime$$ obtained by deleting every edge of $$w$$ (but not the vertices).  Note that every vertex of $$\Gamma^\prime$$ has even degree.  Second, $$\Gamma^\prime$$ may not be connected, but each connected component $$\Gamma_i^\prime$$ of $$\Gamma^\prime$$ has fewer edges that $$\Gamma$$ and hence has an Eulerian tour $$u_i$$ by supposition.  Together, $$w$$ and the $$u_i$$ visit every edge of $$\Gamma$$ exactly once.  We can stitch them together into one closed path as follows -- each $$u_i$$ shares at least one vertex $$v_i$$ with $$w$$.  We trace the path $$w$$, but the first time we visit vertex $$v_i$$ we insert the path $$u_i$$ before continuing along $$w$$.  $$\square$$

Hamiltonian Cycles
---



Definition
====

A graph $$\Gamma$$ is *Hamilton* if there exists a closed walk that visits every vertex exactly once.



Although the definition of a Hamiltonian graph is extremely similar to an Eulerian graph, it is much harder to determine whether a graph is Hamiltonian or not: doing so is an NP-complete problem.



Examples
===



Proposition
===

The Petersen graph is *not* Hamiltonian.

Proof
===

Suppose the Petersen graph was Hamiltonian, and let $$v_0-v_1-v_2-v_3-\cdots-v_{9}-v_0$$ denote the Hamiltonian cycle, as we have drawn below:

<a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=d6v1605k333c292518133v4y2d721y67"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/d6v1605k333c292518133v4y2d721y67.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing"/></a>

The Petersen graph has 15 edges, and the Hamiltonian cycle uses 10 of them, so there must be 5 edges left in the Petersen graph that are not in the Hamiltonian cycle.  The proof works by considering the possibilities for these 5 extra edges.

Let us consider the extra edge incident to $$v_0$$; the others are equivalent.  Since the Petersen graph has no loops or multiple edges, this edge cannot go from $$v_0$$ to itself, or to $$v_1$$ or $$v_9$$.

  Since the Petersen graph has no triangles or 4 cycles, this edge cannot "skip" 1 or 2 vertices in the Hamiltonian cycle.  More specifically, we cannot   we cannot have an edge from $$v_0$$ to $$v_2$$ or $$v_8$$, as these make triangles, as in the dashed edges below:

<a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=d6r2i32k1q4vx542c511q4m6tkc16"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/d6r2i32k1q4vx542c511q4m6tkc16.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing"/></a>

And we cannot have edges $$v_0$$ to $$v_3$$ or to $$v_7$$, as these make 4 cycles:
<a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=d18386i4q5g1d1k5s6r4cm2c5j587270"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/d18386i4q5g1d1k5s6r4cm2c5j587270.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing"/></a>



Thus, the only possibility for these edges is that they "skip" 4 or 5 vertices (skipping more than 5 vertices is the same as skipping less vertices in the other direction).  So for instance, $$v_0$$ can only be connected to $$v_4, v_5$$ or $$v_6$$ with its extra edge. 

We now claim that at least one of these extra edges must "skip" 4 vertices.  If not, then every extra edge would skip 5 vertices.  Since each vertex has degree 3, there must be one extra edge through each of these vertices, connecting to the opposite vertex.  But this configuration has many four cycles -- for instance, $$v_0-v_1-v_6-v_5-v_0$$.  Since the Petersen graph does not have any 4 cycles, we see this cannot occur:

<a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=dc5s2424634t1dn1654k583r3l5k1f"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/dc5s2424634t1dn1654k583r3l5k1f.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing"/></a>

Relabeling our edges if necesary, we can make the extra edge that skips the 4 cycle be the edge $$v_0-v_4$$.  Now, consider the extra edge at $$v_5$$.  This cannot skip 5, because that would make it adjacent to $$v_0$$, which already has its extra edge.  Thus, it must skip 4, and be adjacent to either $$v_9$$ or $$v_1$$.  But since each of these are adjacent to $$v_0$$, it would create a 4-cycle: either $$v_0-v_4-v_5-v_9-v_0$$, or $$v_0-v_4-v_5-v_1-v_0$$.

We have drawn the edge from $$v_0$$ to $$v_4$$ in solid red; any of the dashed edges from $$v_5$$ create a configuration not found in the Petersen graph:

  $$\square$$




Partial results on Hamiltonian graphs
----

Although there is no complete characterisation of Hamiltonian graphs, there are several nice sufficient conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian; 

Ore's Theorem
====

Let $$\Gamma$$ be a simple graph with $$n$$ vertices such that for any two nonadjacent vertices $$v$$ and $$w$$, we have $$\text{deg}(v)+\deg{w}\geq n$$.  Then $$\Gamma$$ is Hamiltonian.

Proof
===

We will give a proof by contradiction.  First, suppose that $$\Gamma$$ were a counterexample.  Adding edges to $$\Gamma$$ preserves the condition on the degrees, and so we may continually add edges to $$\Gamma$$ until adding any more would create a Hamiltonian cycle.  We will thus assume that $$\Gamma$$ is a counterexample with the maximal set of edges.  

The benefit of this is that such a $$\Gamma$$ must have a non-closed path that visits every vertex exactly once.  To see this, add one more edge $$e$$ to $$\Gamma$$ -- the resulting graph then has a Hamiltonian cycle, which must pass through $$e$$, deleting $$e$$ give the desired path.

Let $$v_1-v_2-\dots v_{n-1}-v_n$$ be the path visiting every vertex of $$\Gamma$$.  We will complete the proof by showing there exists an $$i\in 3,\cdots, n-1$$ so that $$v_1$$ is adjacent to $$v_i$$ and $$v_n$$ is adjacent to $$v_{i-1}$$.  This completes the proof because $$v_1-v_2-\cdots v_{i-1}-v_n-v_{n-1}-v_{n-2}-\dots v_i-v_1$$ is a Hamiltonian path.  We illustrate this below, with $$n=9$$ and $$i=5$$:

<a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=d1e3c343k1z5b6a4t2m4n6l1o273m2z4w"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/d1e3c343k1z5b6a4t2m4n6l1o273m2z4w.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing"/></a>

The existence of such an $$i$$ follows from the pigeon hole principle.  Since $$v_1$$ and $$v_n$$ are not adjacent by supposition, the sum of their degrees is at least $$n$$.  Two edges incident to them are accounted for $$v_1-v_2$$, and $$v_{n-1}-v_{n-2}$$, so there must be at least $$n-2$$ other edges incident to $$v_1$$ or $$v_{n}$$.  Since $$\Gamma$$ is simple, any such edge out of $$v_1$$ has $$n-3$$ possibilities:  $$v_3, v_4, \dots, v_{n-1}$$.  Similarly, there are $$n-3$$ possibilities for an edge adjacent to $$v_n$$ -- $$v_2,v_3,\dots, v_{n-2}$$.  We pair these edges up into the possibilities we want, creating $$n-3$$ bins.  Since there are $$n-2$$ edges we need to distribute among these bins, one of the bins must contain at least two, which is exactly what we needed to show.
