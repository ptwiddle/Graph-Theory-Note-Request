<h1>Edited graph theory notes</h1>

By request, this page contains a slightly edited version of last year's notes, that removes the material we didn't cover (long paths, surfaces beyond the torus, A* algorithm), and adds the few extra things that weren't in last notes (Prim's algorithm and gluing formulas for the chromatic polynomial; that's it)
