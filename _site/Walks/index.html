    <p>If the edges in a graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> represent connections, it is obvious to ask whether <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> as a whole is “connected”.  There are two seemingly different ways of making this precise; today we introduce these and show that they are the same.</p>

<p>It may be easiest to define what it means for a graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> to be <em>disconnected</em>.</p>

<h1 id="definition-disjoint-union">Definition: Disjoint union</h1>

<p>Given two graphs <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_2</script>, the <em>disjoint union</em> <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_1\sqcup \Gamma_2</script> is obtained by taking the disjoint union of both the vertices and edges of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_2</script>.  So <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_1\sqcup\Gamma_2</script> consists of a copy of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_1</script> and a copy of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_2</script>, with no edges in between the two graphs.</p>

<h1 id="definition-disconnected">Definition: Disconnected</h1>

<p>A graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is <em>disconnected</em> if we can write <script type="math/tex">\Gamma=\Gamma_1\sqcup \Gamma_2</script> for two proper (i.e., not all of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script>) subgraphs <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_2</script>.</p>

<p>It then makes sense to say that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is <em>connected</em> if it is not disconnected.  However, the more intuitive notion of being connected is that “you can get from any vertex to any other”, which we now make precise.</p>

<h2 id="walks-trails-paths">Walks, Trails, Paths</h2>

<h1 id="definition">Definition</h1>
<p>A <em>walk</em> in a graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is a sequence</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_0, e_1, v_1,e_2, v_2,\dots, v_{n-1}, e_n, v_n</script>

<p>where</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <script type="math/tex">v_i</script> are vertices</li>
  <li>the <script type="math/tex">e_j</script> are edges</li>
  <li>edge <script type="math/tex">e_j</script> goes between vertices <script type="math/tex">v_{j-1}</script> and <script type="math/tex">v_j</script></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, when the graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> does not have multiple edges, it is enough to record just the <script type="math/tex">v_i</script>, but if <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> has multiple edges that just knowing the vertices does not determine the walk.</p>

<p>We say that the walk is between vertices <script type="math/tex">a</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script> if <script type="math/tex">a=v_0</script> to vertex <script type="math/tex">b=v_n</script>.  Thus, it is natural to say that a graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is connected if there is a walk between any two vertices <script type="math/tex">a,b\in\Gamma</script>.  We now show that this agrees with our previous definition of connected.</p>

<h1 id="lemma">Lemma</h1>
<p>The following are equivalent:</p>

<ol>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is connected.</li>
  <li>There is a walk between any two vertices <script type="math/tex">v, w\in V(\Gamma)</script></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="proof">Proof</h1>

<p>1 implies 2: Supppose that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is connected, and let <script type="math/tex">v, w\in V(\Gamma)</script>; we want to show that there is a walk from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">w</script>.</p>

<p>Define <script type="math/tex">S\subset V(\Gamma)</script> to be the set of all vertices <script type="math/tex">u\in V(\Gamma)</script> so that there is a walk from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">u</script>; we want to show that <script type="math/tex">w\in S</script>.</p>

<p>First, observe that there are no edges from <script type="math/tex">S</script> to <script type="math/tex">V(\Gamma)\setminus S</script>.  Suppose that <script type="math/tex">e</script> was an edge between <script type="math/tex">a\in S</script> and <script type="math/tex">b\in\Gamma\setminus S</script>.  Since <script type="math/tex">a\in S</script>, by the definition of <script type="math/tex">S</script> there is a walk <script type="math/tex">v=v_0v_1v_2\cdots v_m=a</script> from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">a</script>.  We can add the edge <script type="math/tex">e</script> to the end of the walk, to get a walk from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">b</script>, and hence by definition <script type="math/tex">b\in S</script>.</p>

<p>Now suppose that <script type="math/tex">w\notin S</script>.  Then <script type="math/tex">S</script> and <script type="math/tex">V(\Gamma)\setminus S</script> are both nonempty, and by the above there are no edges between them, and so <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is not connected, a contradiction.</p>

<p>To prove 2 implies 1, we prove the contrapositive.  If <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is not connected, then there are two vertices <script type="math/tex">v,w\in V(\Gamma)</script> so that there is no walk from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">w</script>.</p>

<p>Suppose that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma=\Gamma_1\sqcup\Gamma_2</script>, and pick <script type="math/tex">v\in V(\Gamma_1), w\in V(\Gamma_2)</script>.  Any walk from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">w</script> starts in <script type="math/tex">V(\Gamma_1)</script> and ends in <script type="math/tex">V(\Gamma_2)</script>, and so at some point there must be an edge from a vertex in <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_1</script> to a vertex in <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_2</script>, but there are no such edges <script type="math/tex">\square</script></p>

<h2 id="types-of-walks">Types of Walks</h2>

<p>Many questions in graph theory ask whether or not a walk of a certain type exists on a graph: we introduce some notation that will be needed for these questions.</p>

<p>We say a walk is <em>closed</em> if it starts and ends on the same vertex; i.e., <script type="math/tex">v_0=v_n</script>.  The <em>length</em> of a walk is <script type="math/tex">n</script>, the number of edges in it.  The <em>distance</em> between two vertices <script type="math/tex">v</script> and <script type="math/tex">w</script> is the length of the shortest walk from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">w</script>, if one exists, and <script type="math/tex">\infty</script> if one does not exist.</p>

<h1 id="walks-trails-and-paths">Walks, trails and paths</h1>

<ul>
  <li>If the edges <script type="math/tex">e_i</script> of the walk are all distinct, we call it a <em>trail</em></li>
  <li>If the vertices <script type="math/tex">v_i</script> of the walk are all distinct (except possibly <script type="math/tex">v_0=v_m</script>), we call the walk a <em>path</em>.  The exception is to allow for the possibility of closed paths.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="lemma-1">Lemma</h1>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">v,w\in V(\Gamma)</script>.  The following are equivalent:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is a walk from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">w</script>.</li>
  <li>There is a trail from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">w</script></li>
  <li>There is a path from <script type="math/tex">v</script> to <script type="math/tex">w</script>.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="proof-1">Proof</h1>

<p>Obviously, 3 implies 2 which implies 1, as any path is a trail, and any trail is a walk.</p>

<p>That 1 implies 3 is intuitively obvious: if you repeat a vertex, then you’ve visited someplace twice, and weren’t taking the shortest route.  Let’s make this argument mathematically precise.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a walk <script type="math/tex">v=v_0,e_1,\dots, e_m, v_m=w</script> that is not a path.  Then, we must repeat some vertex, say <script type="math/tex">v_i=v_k</script>, with <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
i<k %]]></script>.  Then we can cut out all the vertices and edges between <script type="math/tex">v_i</script> and <script type="math/tex">v_k</script> to obtain a new walk</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">v=v_0,e_1, v_1,\dots, e_i, v_i, e_{k+1}, v_{k+1}, e_{k+2}, v_{k+2}, \dots, v_m</script>.</p>

<p>Since <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
i<k %]]></script>, the new walk is strictly shorter than our original walk.  Since the length of a walk is finite, if we iterate this process the result must eventually terminate.  That means all our vertices are distinct, and hence is a path.  <script type="math/tex">\square</script></p>

<p>The field of graph theory arguably began with the following question.</p>

<h2 id="the-bridges-of-konigsberg">The Bridges of Konigsberg</h2>

<p>the city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad) was built on both sides of a river, and contained two large islands.  The 4 sectors of the city were connected by seven bridges, as follows (picture from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">Wikipedia</a>):</p>

<p><img src="../Konigsberg_bridges.png" alt="Konigsberg in Euler's time" /></p>

<p>A group of friends enjoyed strolling through the city, and created a game: could they take a walk in the city, crossing every bridge exactly once, and return to where they started from?  Eventually, Euler proved that such a walk is not possible, and in doing so founded graph theory.</p>

<h2 id="eulerian-cycles">Eulerian Cycles</h2>

<p>Before presenting Euler’s proof,  let us formulate the question precisely in terms of graph theory, which will also generalize the problem.</p>

<p>We can produce a graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_K</script>, which we will callt he Kingsberg graph, that represents the city of Konigsberg as follows.  There will be four vertices, representing the four land-masses are vertices.  Every bridge will be represented by an edge.</p>

<p>Then, the question reduces to finding a closed walk in the graph that will uses every edge exactly once.  In particular, this walk will not use any edge more than once and hence will be a trail (though it may repeat vertices).</p>

<h1 id="definition-eulerian-cycle">Definition: Eulerian cycle</h1>
<p>Let <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> be any graph. An <em>Eulerian cycle</em> or <em>Eulerian tour</em> is a walk in <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> that visits every edge exactly once.</p>

<p>The citizens Konigsberg were asking whether an Eulerian cycle existed in <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_K</script>.  Euler did more: he gave simple criterion to tell whether or not <em>any</em> connected graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> has an Eulerian tour.  We will now state and prove his result.</p>

<h1 id="theorem">Theorem</h1>

<p>A connected graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> (without loops) has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> has even degree.</p>

<h1 id="proof-2">Proof</h1>

<p>First, we show this condition is necessary.  Let <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> be a connected graph, and suppose that it has an Eulerian cycle <script type="math/tex">w=v_0, e_1, v_1,\dots, e_n, v_n</script>.  Let <script type="math/tex">v</script> be any vertex in <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script>; we must show that <script type="math/tex">v</script> has even degree.  We will do this by pairing up the edges incident to <script type="math/tex">v</script>.</p>

<p>Since <script type="math/tex">w</script> is a closed walked, we may assume that it does not start at <script type="math/tex">v</script>.  Then consider the first time that the walk <script type="math/tex">w</script> visits <script type="math/tex">v</script> – it will enter by some edge <script type="math/tex">e_i</script>, and leave by some other edge <script type="math/tex">e_{i+1}</script>.  We pair these two edges up.</p>

<p>The walk <script type="math/tex">w</script> may visit <script type="math/tex">v</script> multiple times; each time it does, it must enter from one edge, and leave from another edge.  Each time the walk <script type="math/tex">w</script> visits <script type="math/tex">e</script>, we will pair up the edge the walk <script type="math/tex">w</script> entered with the edge <script type="math/tex">w</script> left by.  Since by supposition the walk <script type="math/tex">w</script> uses every edge of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> exactly once, we see that every edge incident to <script type="math/tex">v</script> will be paired up with exactly one other edge in this way, and hence <script type="math/tex">v</script> must have even degree.</p>

<p>We now show that this condition is sufficient.  That is, we suppose that every vertex of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> has even degree; we must show that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> has an Eulerian cycle.  We will proceed by induction on the number of edges of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script>.</p>

<p>Any connected graph with 0 edges consists of just a vertex, and hence trivially has an Eulerian cycle.</p>

<p>Now, for the inductive step, we suppose that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> has <script type="math/tex">n</script> edges, and further suppose that we know Euler’s theorem is true for all graphs with less than <script type="math/tex">n</script> edges – that is, suppose that every connected graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> with less than <script type="math/tex">n</script> edges, all of whose vertices have even degree has an Eulerian walk.</p>

<p>We first claim that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> has <em>some</em> closed trail.  Start at any vertex <script type="math/tex">v_0</script>.  Since <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is connected, <script type="math/tex">v_0</script> has at least one edge <script type="math/tex">e_1</script> so we start our trail with <script type="math/tex">v_0, e_1, v_1</script>.  Since every vertex has an even degree, there must be another edge out of <script type="math/tex">v_1</script>, say <script type="math/tex">e_2</script> leading to <script type="math/tex">v_2</script>.</p>

<p>We continue building a trail in <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> by randomly selecting an unused edge of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> at our current vertex.  Since every vertex has even degree, and whenever our trail visits a vertex we use up edges two at a time (coming and going), we see that whenever we arrive at a vertex <script type="math/tex">v</script>, there must be another edge leaving it to continue our trail – unless perhaps we hit our starting vertex <script type="math/tex">v_0</script>, where we have only used one edge up.  Thus, if we randomly start building a trail we must eventually return to our starting vertex and obtain a closed trail.</p>

<p>Now, given our graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script>, we know it has <em>some</em> closed trail <script type="math/tex">w</script>.  If <script type="math/tex">w</script> uses every edge of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script>, we are done.  If not, we consider the new graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma^\prime</script> obtained by deleting every edge of <script type="math/tex">w</script> (but not the vertices).  Note that every vertex of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma^\prime</script> has even degree.  Second, <script type="math/tex">\Gamma^\prime</script> may not be connected, but each connected component <script type="math/tex">\Gamma_i^\prime</script> of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma^\prime</script> has fewer edges that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> and hence has an Eulerian tour <script type="math/tex">u_i</script> by supposition.  Together, <script type="math/tex">w</script> and the <script type="math/tex">u_i</script> visit every edge of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> exactly once.  We can stitch them together into one closed path as follows – each <script type="math/tex">u_i</script> shares at least one vertex <script type="math/tex">v_i</script> with <script type="math/tex">w</script>.  We trace the path <script type="math/tex">w</script>, but the first time we visit vertex <script type="math/tex">v_i</script> we insert the path <script type="math/tex">u_i</script> before continuing along <script type="math/tex">w</script>.  <script type="math/tex">\square</script></p>

<h2 id="hamiltonian-cycles">Hamiltonian Cycles</h2>

<h1 id="definition-1">Definition</h1>

<p>A graph <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is <em>Hamilton</em> if there exists a closed walk that visits every vertex exactly once.</p>

<p>Although the definition of a Hamiltonian graph is extremely similar to an Eulerian graph, it is much harder to determine whether a graph is Hamiltonian or not: doing so is an NP-complete problem.</p>

<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>

<h1 id="proposition">Proposition</h1>

<p>The Petersen graph is <em>not</em> Hamiltonian.</p>

<h1 id="proof-3">Proof</h1>

<p>Suppose the Petersen graph was Hamiltonian, and let <script type="math/tex">v_0-v_1-v_2-v_3-\cdots-v_{9}-v_0</script> denote the Hamiltonian cycle, as we have drawn below:</p>

<p><a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=d6v1605k333c292518133v4y2d721y67"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/d6v1605k333c292518133v4y2d721y67.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing" /></a></p>

<p>The Petersen graph has 15 edges, and the Hamiltonian cycle uses 10 of them, so there must be 5 edges left in the Petersen graph that are not in the Hamiltonian cycle.  The proof works by considering the possibilities for these 5 extra edges.</p>

<p>Let us consider the extra edge incident to <script type="math/tex">v_0</script>; the others are equivalent.  Since the Petersen graph has no loops or multiple edges, this edge cannot go from <script type="math/tex">v_0</script> to itself, or to <script type="math/tex">v_1</script> or <script type="math/tex">v_9</script>.</p>

<p>Since the Petersen graph has no triangles or 4 cycles, this edge cannot “skip” 1 or 2 vertices in the Hamiltonian cycle.  More specifically, we cannot   we cannot have an edge from <script type="math/tex">v_0</script> to <script type="math/tex">v_2</script> or <script type="math/tex">v_8</script>, as these make triangles, as in the dashed edges below:</p>

<p><a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=d6r2i32k1q4vx542c511q4m6tkc16"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/d6r2i32k1q4vx542c511q4m6tkc16.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing" /></a></p>

<p>And we cannot have edges <script type="math/tex">v_0</script> to <script type="math/tex">v_3</script> or to <script type="math/tex">v_7</script>, as these make 4 cycles:
<a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=d18386i4q5g1d1k5s6r4cm2c5j587270"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/d18386i4q5g1d1k5s6r4cm2c5j587270.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing" /></a></p>

<p>Thus, the only possibility for these edges is that they “skip” 4 or 5 vertices (skipping more than 5 vertices is the same as skipping less vertices in the other direction).  So for instance, <script type="math/tex">v_0</script> can only be connected to <script type="math/tex">v_4, v_5</script> or <script type="math/tex">v_6</script> with its extra edge.</p>

<p>We now claim that at least one of these extra edges must “skip” 4 vertices.  If not, then every extra edge would skip 5 vertices.  Since each vertex has degree 3, there must be one extra edge through each of these vertices, connecting to the opposite vertex.  But this configuration has many four cycles – for instance, <script type="math/tex">v_0-v_1-v_6-v_5-v_0</script>.  Since the Petersen graph does not have any 4 cycles, we see this cannot occur:</p>

<p><a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=dc5s2424634t1dn1654k583r3l5k1f"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/dc5s2424634t1dn1654k583r3l5k1f.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing" /></a></p>

<p>Relabeling our edges if necesary, we can make the extra edge that skips the 4 cycle be the edge <script type="math/tex">v_0-v_4</script>.  Now, consider the extra edge at <script type="math/tex">v_5</script>.  This cannot skip 5, because that would make it adjacent to <script type="math/tex">v_0</script>, which already has its extra edge.  Thus, it must skip 4, and be adjacent to either <script type="math/tex">v_9</script> or <script type="math/tex">v_1</script>.  But since each of these are adjacent to <script type="math/tex">v_0</script>, it would create a 4-cycle: either <script type="math/tex">v_0-v_4-v_5-v_9-v_0</script>, or <script type="math/tex">v_0-v_4-v_5-v_1-v_0</script>.</p>

<p>We have drawn the edge from <script type="math/tex">v_0</script> to <script type="math/tex">v_4</script> in solid red; any of the dashed edges from <script type="math/tex">v_5</script> create a configuration not found in the Petersen graph:</p>

<h2 id="partial-results-on-hamiltonian-graphs">Partial results on Hamiltonian graphs</h2>

<p>Although there is no complete characterisation of Hamiltonian graphs, there are several nice sufficient conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian;</p>

<h1 id="ores-theorem">Ore’s Theorem</h1>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> be a simple graph with <script type="math/tex">n</script> vertices such that for any two nonadjacent vertices <script type="math/tex">v</script> and <script type="math/tex">w</script>, we have <script type="math/tex">\text{deg}(v)+\deg{w}\geq n</script>.  Then <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is Hamiltonian.</p>

<h1 id="proof-4">Proof</h1>

<p>We will give a proof by contradiction.  First, suppose that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> were a counterexample.  Adding edges to <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> preserves the condition on the degrees, and so we may continually add edges to <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> until adding any more would create a Hamiltonian cycle.  We will thus assume that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is a counterexample with the maximal set of edges.</p>

<p>The benefit of this is that such a <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> must have a non-closed path that visits every vertex exactly once.  To see this, add one more edge <script type="math/tex">e</script> to <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> – the resulting graph then has a Hamiltonian cycle, which must pass through <script type="math/tex">e</script>, deleting <script type="math/tex">e</script> give the desired path.</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">v_1-v_2-\dots v_{n-1}-v_n</script> be the path visiting every vertex of <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script>.  We will complete the proof by showing there exists an <script type="math/tex">i\in 3,\cdots, n-1</script> so that <script type="math/tex">v_1</script> is adjacent to <script type="math/tex">v_i</script> and <script type="math/tex">v_n</script> is adjacent to <script type="math/tex">v_{i-1}</script>.  This completes the proof because <script type="math/tex">v_1-v_2-\cdots v_{i-1}-v_n-v_{n-1}-v_{n-2}-\dots v_i-v_1</script> is a Hamiltonian path.  We illustrate this below, with <script type="math/tex">n=9</script> and <script type="math/tex">i=5</script>:</p>

<p><a href="http://presheaf.com/?d=d1e3c343k1z5b6a4t2m4n6l1o273m2z4w"><img src="http://presheaf.com/cache/d1e3c343k1z5b6a4t2m4n6l1o273m2z4w.png" title="click to go to presheaf.com for editing" /></a></p>

<p>The existence of such an <script type="math/tex">i</script> follows from the pigeon hole principle.  Since <script type="math/tex">v_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">v_n</script> are not adjacent by supposition, the sum of their degrees is at least <script type="math/tex">n</script>.  Two edges incident to them are accounted for <script type="math/tex">v_1-v_2</script>, and <script type="math/tex">v_{n-1}-v_{n-2}</script>, so there must be at least <script type="math/tex">n-2</script> other edges incident to <script type="math/tex">v_1</script> or <script type="math/tex">v_{n}</script>.  Since <script type="math/tex">\Gamma</script> is simple, any such edge out of <script type="math/tex">v_1</script> has <script type="math/tex">n-3</script> possibilities:  <script type="math/tex">v_3, v_4, \dots, v_{n-1}</script>.  Similarly, there are <script type="math/tex">n-3</script> possibilities for an edge adjacent to <script type="math/tex">v_n</script> – <script type="math/tex">v_2,v_3,\dots, v_{n-2}</script>.  We pair these edges up into the possibilities we want, creating <script type="math/tex">n-3</script> bins.  Since there are <script type="math/tex">n-2</script> edges we need to distribute among these bins, one of the bins must contain at least two, which is exactly what we needed to show.</p>
